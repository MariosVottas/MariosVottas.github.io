        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Marios. I am 24 years old currently leaving in Athens,Greece. I enjoy having a good time 24/7, most likely you will
            see me with a smile on my face. Life is beautiful and we should enjoy every second of it. So please, don't waste my time with
            sad events unless it is really important. With that said, I don't like wasting time, not in my personal time nor in my 
            working enviroment. I try to operate the same way both in the office and in my personal time. I want to hear solutions, not problems.
            But now, I am going to rescind my previous statement because the truth is... <strong> I adore being able to provide solutions.</strong> To my loved 
            ones because I can show them how much they mean to me, to my friends because I care about them, and to my work place because I can 
            practically show my value. And this is the reason why I like <strong>Analytics and Machine Learning</strong>. These are fields where
            the results of my work can have a visible impact, to me, my clients and my employeer. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            The most satisfying feeling is when projects 
            work and deliver the expected results, and many times even better ones. Analytics can help a business profit, grow and find it's 
            flaws. While analytics is the first step, I strongly believe that Machine Learning can help a business <b>grow</b>. But machine 
            learning is a lot more than a tool to make money. It is a tool that can revolutionize the modern way of life, we have already seen it 
            with ChatGPT, recommendation engines, face recognition and many more every day technologies that most of the population don't even 
            know it was developed using machine learning. Moreover, the uses of machine learning in health and risk management can be very 
            benefitional. For example, in my Msc we had a small project to review a paper. The paper we chose was about sensor that measure 
            temperature, humidity and some other factors in order to calculate the risk of fire. A similar system is being tested in a forest
            in Greece.

        <h3>Drug to Drug Interaction Prediction Graph</h3>
        <p>
            This is my Master thesis project. In this project I try to improve a previous paper published by my professor. It is a research
            project, where I am trying to predicted the Interaction between Lung Cancer Drugs. The dataset is contained of Drugs, Proteins, 
            Hormones and many other instances. My responsibility is to create and develop a model which can identify accurately the type 
            of interaction that may happen between two drugs as well as find new possible interactions that have not yet been discovered.
            This project is being developed using: <br>
            Python <br>
            Neo4j <br>
        </p>
    
        <h3>Medical Image Classification</h3>
        <p>
            This Deep Learnign project was developed with a colleague during our Master's in Data Science. We wanted to classify XRAY images
            and be able to  accurately predict if the patient has Pneumonia or not. So we decided to approach this problem with two different ways. <br>
            1. Develop our "own" CNN architecture. This was a series of experiment to understand deeper how CNNs work and what is effective 
            in a real project <br>
            2. Trasfer Learning. We took some already tested architectures and fitted it into our specific problem. <br>
            This project is being developed using: <br>
            Python (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn)<br>
            TensorFlow<br>
            Jupyter Notebook <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Naval data collection and storage system</h3>
        <p>
            This project was my Thesis for my Bachelor in Informatics and Telecommunications degree. It is basically a web scaper which can access websites that have 
            available the real time location of Vessels worldwide. Once the data was scraped, then the data needs to be stored and be accesible for analysis. A NoSQL 
            database was chosen for this task since it is generally better for large ammounts of data. Furthermore, I picked it because I had already seen SQL and
            wanted to experiment with new technologies. <br>
            For this project I used:
            1. Python (Scrapy) <br>
            2. ElasticSearch<br>
            3. Logstash<br>
            4. Kibana <br>
