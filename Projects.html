        <h3>Drug to Drug Interaction Prediction Graph</h3>
        <p>
            This is my Master thesis project. In this project I try to improve a previous paper published by my professor. It is a research
            project, where I am trying to predicted the Interaction between Lung Cancer Drugs. The dataset is contained of Drugs, Proteins, 
            Hormones and many other instances. My responsibility is to create and develop a model which can identify accurately the type 
            of interaction that may happen between two drugs as well as find new possible interactions that have not yet been discovered.
            This project is being developed using: <br>
            Python <br>
            Neo4j <br>
        </p>
    
        <h3>Medical Image Classification</h3>
        <p>
            This Deep Learnign project was developed with a colleague during our Master's in Data Science. We wanted to classify XRAY images
            and be able to  accurately predict if the patient has Pneumonia or not. So we decided to approach this problem with two different ways. <br>
            1. Develop our "own" CNN architecture. This was a series of experiment to understand deeper how CNNs work and what is effective 
            in a real project <br>
            2. Trasfer Learning. We took some already tested architectures and fitted it into our specific problem. <br>
            This project is being developed using: <br>
            Python (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn)<br>
            TensorFlow<br>
            Jupyter Notebook <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Naval data collection and storage system</h3>
        <p>
            This project was my Thesis for my Bachelor in Informatics and Telecommunications degree. It is basically a web scaper which can access websites that have 
            available the real time location of Vessels worldwide. Once the data was scraped, then the data needs to be stored and be accesible for analysis. A NoSQL 
            database was chosen for this task since it is generally better for large ammounts of data. Furthermore, I picked it because I had already seen SQL and
            wanted to experiment with new technologies. <br>
            For this project I used:
            1. Python (Scrapy) <br>
            2. ElasticSearch<br>
            3. Logstash<br>
            4. Kibana <br>
